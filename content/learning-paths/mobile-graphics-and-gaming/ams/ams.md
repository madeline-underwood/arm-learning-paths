[Arm Performance Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Mobile%20Studio) (formerly known as Arm Mobile Studio) is a suite of performance analysis tools that help developers test and optimize applications on devices with Mali-based GPUs. It includes five easy-to-use tools that show you how well your application performs either on off-the-shelf Android devices or Linux targets. The tools help you to identify problems that might slow down performance, overheat the device, or drain the battery.

| Component | Functionality |
|----------|-------------|
| [Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Streamline%20Performance%20Analyzer) | Captures a performance profile that shows all the performance counter activity from the device. |
| [Performance Advisor](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Performance%20Advisor) | Generates a summary report from a Streamline capture and provides actionable optimization advice. |
| [Frame Advisor](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Frame%20Advisor) | Captures API calls and rendering data from a specific frame to identify potential performance issues. |
| [Mali Offline Compiler](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Mali%20Offline%20Compiler) | Analyzes shader performance across a range of Mali GPUs. |
| [RenderDoc for Arm GPUs](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/RenderDoc%20for%20Arm%20GPUs) | Debugs Vulkan graphics applications and supports Arm GPU extensions and Android features. |

Arm Performance Studio is supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS hosts. 

See the [Arm Performance Studio install guide](/install-guides/ams/) for installation instructions.
