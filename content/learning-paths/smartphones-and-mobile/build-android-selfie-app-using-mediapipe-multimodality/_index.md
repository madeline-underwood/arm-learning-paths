learning_objectives: 
    - Architect a modern Android app focusing on the UI layer.
    - Leverage lifecycle-aware components within the MVVM architecture.
    - Combine MediaPipe's face landmark detection and gesture recognition for a multimodel selfie solution.
    - Use JetPack CameraX to access camera features.
    - Use Kotlin Flow APIs to handle multiple asynchronous data streams.
